# Introducing Lost Fortune


![ScreenShot](../../web/Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming/Image_067.gif)

The final project for this chapter, Lost Fortune, is a personalized adventure game in which the player enters a few pieces of information, which the computer uses to enhance a basic adventure story. Figure 1.9 shows a sample run.

I include the file `string`, part of the standard library, so I can use a `string` object to access a string through a variable. There’s a lot more to `string` objects, but I’m going to keep you in suspense. You’ll learn more about them in Chapter 3, “For Loops, Strings, and Arrays: Word Jumble.”

Also, I employ `using` directives to spell out the objects in the `std` namespace that I plan to access. As a result, you can clearly see that `string` is in namespace `std`.

## Getting Information from the Player

Next I get some information from the player.

```cpp
int main()
{
	const int GOLD_PIECES = 900;
	int adventurers, killed, survivors;
	string leader;

	//get the information
	cout << "Welcome to Lost Fortune\n\n";
	cout << "Please enter the following for your personalized adventure\n";

	cout << "Enter a number: ";
	cin >> adventurers;

	cout << "Enter a number, smaller than the first: ";
	cin >> killed;

	survivors = adventurers - killed;

	cout << "Enter your last name: ";
	cin >> leader;
```

`GOLD_PIECES` is a constant that stores the number of gold pieces in the fortune the `adventurers` seek. adventurers stores the number of adventurers on the quest. `killed` stores the number that are killed on the journey. I calculate `survivors` for the number of adventurers that remain. Finally, I get the player’s last name, which I’ll be able to access through `leader`.

### Trap
> This simple use of `cin` to get a string from the user only works with strings that have no whitespace in them (such as tabs or spaces). There are ways to compensate for this, but that really requires a discussion of something called *streams*, which is beyond the scope of this chapter. So, use `cin` in this way, but be aware of its limitations.

## Telling the Story

Next I use the variables to tell the story

```cpp
//tell the story
	cout << "\nA brave group of " << adventurers << " set out on a quest ";
	cout << "-- in search of the lost treasure of the Ancient Dwarves. ";
	cout << "The group was led by that legendary rogue, " << leader << " .\n";

	cout << "\nAlong the way, a band of marauding ogres ambushed the party. ";
	cout << "All fought bravely under the command of " << leader;
	cout << ", and the orges were defeated, but a cost. ";
	cout << "Of the adventures, " << killed << " were vanquished.";
	cout << "leaving just " << survivors << " in the group.\n";

	cout << "\nThe party was about to give up all hope. "; 
	cout << "But while laying the deceased to rest. ";
	cout << "they stumbled upon the buried fortune. ";
	cout << "So the adventures split " << GOLD_PIECES << " gold pieces.";
	cout << leader << " held on to the extra " << (GOLD_PIECES % survivors);
	cout << " pieces to keep things fair of course.\n";

	return 0;
}
```

The code and thrilling narrative are pretty clear. I will point out one thing, though. To calculate the number of gold pieces that the leader keeps, I use the modulus operator in the expression `GOLD_PIECES % survivors`. The expression evaluates to the remainder of `GOLD_PIECES / survivors`, which is the number of gold pieces that would be left after evenly dividing the stash among all of the surviving adventurers.

# Code
```cpp
// Lost Fortune
// A personalized adventure

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::endl;
using std::string;

int main()
{
	const int GOLD_PIECES = 900;
	int adventurers, killed, survivors;
	string leader;

	//get the information
	cout << "Welcome to Lost Fortune\n\n";
	cout << "Please enter the following for your personalized adventure\n";

	cout << "Enter a number: ";
	cin >> adventurers;

	cout << "Enter a number, smaller than the first: ";
	cin >> killed;

	survivors = adventurers - killed;

	cout << "Enter your last name: ";
	cin >> leader;

	//tell the story
	cout << "\nA brave group of " << adventurers << " set out on a quest ";
	cout << "-- in search of the lost treasure of the Ancient Dwarves. ";
	cout << "The group was led by that legendary rogue, " << leader << " .\n";

	cout << "\nAlong the way, a band of marauding ogres ambushed the party. ";
	cout << "All fought bravely under the command of " << leader;
	cout << ", and the orges were defeated, but a cost. ";
	cout << "Of the adventures, " << killed << " were vanquished.";
	cout << "leaving just " << survivors << " in the group.\n";

	cout << "\nThe party was about to give up all hope. "; 
	cout << "But while laying the deceased to rest. ";
	cout << "they stumbled upon the buried fortune. ";
	cout << "So the adventures split " << GOLD_PIECES << " gold pieces.";
	cout << leader << " held on to the extra " << (GOLD_PIECES % survivors);
	cout << " pieces to keep things fair of course.\n";

	return 0;
}
```
