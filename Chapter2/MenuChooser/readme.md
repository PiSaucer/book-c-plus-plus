# Introducing the Menu Chooser Program

![ScreenShot](../../web/Beginning_Cpp_Through_Game_Programming/Image_089.gif)

The Menu Choose Program presents the user with a menu that lists three difficulty levels and asks him to make a choice. If the user enters a number that corresponds to a listed choice, then he is shown message confirming the choice. If the the user makes some other choice, he is told that choice is invalid.

## Creating Multiple Ways to Branch

The `switch` statement creates four possible branching points. If the user enters 1, then code associated with `case 1` is execured and "You picked Easy" is displayed. If the user enters 2, then code associated with `case 2` is executed and "You picked Normal: is displayed. If the user enters 3, then code associated with `case 3` is executed and "You picked Hard" is displayed. If the user enters any other value, then `default` kicks in and "You made an illegal choice" is displayed.

### Trap
> You'll almost always want to end each case with a `break` statement. Don't forget them; otherwise, your code might do things you never intended.

## Using While Loops

`while` loops let you repeat sections of code as long as an expression is `true`. Here's a generic form of the `while` loop:

```cpp
while (expression)
    statement;
```

If `expression` is `false`, the program moves on to the statement after the loop. If `expression` is `true`, the program executes `statment` and loops back to test `expression` again. This cycle repeats until `expression` test `false`, at which point the loop ends.

# Code
```cpp
// Menu Chooser
// Demostartes the switch statement

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Difficulty Levels\n\n";
	cout << "1 - Easy\n";
	cout << "2 - Normal\n";
	cout << "3 - Hard\n\n";

	int choice;
	cout << "Choice: ";
	cin >> choice;

	switch (choice) {
	case 1: 
		cout << "You picked Easy. \n";
		break;

	case 2: 
		cout << "You picked Normal.\n";
		break;

	case 3: 
		cout << "You picked Hard.\n";
		break;

	default:
		cout << "You made an illegal choice.\n";
	}

	return 0;
}
```

# Output

## Easy
```
Difficulty Levels

1 - Easy
2 - Normal
3 - Hard

Choice: 1
You picked Easy.
```

## Normal
```
Difficulty Levels

1 - Easy
2 - Normal
3 - Hard

Choice: 2
You picked Normal.
```

## Hard
```
Difficulty Levels

1 - Easy
2 - Normal
3 - Hard

Choice: 3
You picked Hard.
